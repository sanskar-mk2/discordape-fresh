## This is my blog

I can write this blog in md.
What is MD? Oh, it's called markdown.
It is used to author content-heavy pages I guess.
Wouldn't it be great if there was date and author?
I would like to put images in it i guess

Wow I can put 
Better work on 
I don't trust twitter enough to embed their scripts in my site
